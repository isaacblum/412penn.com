# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.
# This file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use 'bundle exec jekyll serve'.
# If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: "Our neighborhood is located on the Northeast side of Walsenburg, with mostly single family homes North of the railroad tracks.  Quiet days are perfect to enjoy the weather and watch deer graze on grass and shrubs.  Our porch is a perfect spot to watch the sunset behind the Spanish Peaks. From our property, it's easy to access the Walsenburg Mercantile and Main Street corridor by foot."
