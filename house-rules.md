## 🛬 Check-In Guide

### 🚪 Arrival & Entry

**Preferred Entry - Back Door:**  
Due to the home’s hillside location, the front stairs may be uneven or steep. The concrete and railing show signs of wear. We recommend using the back door at the top of the driveway near the covered carport, especially if you have mobility concerns or are carrying luggage.

**Front Stairs Use Notice:**  
Use of the front stairs is at your discretion. If you or anyone in your group may have difficulty with stairs, please avoid the front entrance and use the back driveway door.

## 🔐 Door Locks & Entry Codes

Both the front and back doors are equipped with **electronic keypad locks**. You will be provided with a unique PIN code for your stay.

To unlock:  
✅ Enter your code on the keypad.  
✅ Press the **large oval button** located at the bottom of the number ring to confirm.

**Door Lock Tips:**  
Depending on temperature and weather, you may need to gently pull or push the door while unlocking to align the deadbolt. This is normal due to seasonal expansion. Please do not force the lock.
